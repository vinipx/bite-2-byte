{"question": "Sure, self-service is amazing for businesses. Not only does it save a lot of bucks compared to human-based support, but also requires little supervision, if the tech is trained well. A lot of enterprises are moving their support to self-service and are trying to maximize their usage.

Empathy is one quality that AI bots haven\u2019t had programmed in yet.

{"question": "If humans can be more effective, then why do agents still make errors?", "answer": "Just as contact center technology changed dramatically, the role of agents has too. A contact center employee/agent handles an average of over 110 interactions a day. Each interaction has its intricacies. Customers can potentially ask anything under the sun. Training programs try to cover almost next to everything.
